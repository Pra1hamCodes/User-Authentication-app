# Basic User Authentication App with Firebase (Android)

![App Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Basic User Authentication App with Firebase! This Android app is a simple example of how to implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication in Android Studio using Java. Firebase Authentication provides a secure and easy way to manage user sign-up and sign-in processes in your Android applications.

This README will guide you through setting up the project, understanding its structure, and using it as a starting point for building your own Android apps with user authentication.

## Features

- User Registration: Allow users to create accounts with email and password.
- User Login: Enable existing users to log in to the app securely.
- User Sign Out: Allow users to sign out of their accounts.
- Firebase Integration: Utilize Firebase Authentication to manage user accounts.
- Error Handling: Implement error handling for common authentication scenarios.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Basic User Authentication App:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-authentication-app.git
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**:

   - Open Android Studio.
   - Click on "File" > "Open" and select the cloned project directory.

3. **Configure Firebase**:

   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new Firebase project.
   - Add an Android app to your Firebase project, and follow the setup instructions to download the `google-services.json` file.
   - Place the `google-services.json` file in the `app` directory of your project.

4. **Run the App**:

   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator.
   - Click the "Run" button in Android Studio to build and install the app on your device/emulator.

5. **Test User Authentication**:

   - Use the app to register a new account, log in, and log out.
   - Verify that user authentication is working as expected.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical Android app layout with important files and directories:

- `app/src/main/java/com/yourdomain/yourapp`: Contains Java code for the app.
  - `MainActivity.java`: The main activity that handles user authentication.
  - `RegisterActivity.java`: Activity for user registration.
  - `LoginActivity.java`: Activity for user login.
- `app/src/main/res`: Contains resources like layouts, strings, and images.
- `app/build.gradle`: App-level Gradle build file for dependencies and configurations.

## Firebase Configuration

Firebase Authentication is integrated into the app through the `google-services.json` file. Make sure to replace it with your own Firebase project configuration.

## Usage

This app provides a basic example of user authentication with Firebase. You can use it as a starting point for building more complex Android applications that require user management.

- **User Registration**: Click the "Register" button to create a new account with an email and password.

- **User Login**: After registration, log in using your registered email and password.

- **Sign Out**: You can sign out of your account by clicking the "Sign Out" button.

- **Error Handling**: The app includes basic error handling for authentication, such as invalid email or password.

## Dependencies

The app uses Firebase Authentication, which is configured in the `build.gradle` file. Ensure that you have an internet connection to allow Firebase to work correctly.
